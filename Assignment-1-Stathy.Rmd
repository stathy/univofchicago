# Assignment 1

## 1.1 Data Wrangling

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# This is a code comment; when you run this chunk by clicking the green arrow or clt + enter, R will ignore any comment text

# Uncomment this command to install tidyverse. You can also install the tidyverse via the package tab on the right in RStudio 
install.packages("tidyverse")
# The janitor package is used for cleaning column names (explained later in this document)
install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)
# skimr is a helper package for inspecting missing values
install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Ignore the few parsing errors you see here
df_sandy <- read_csv("data/sandyrelated.csv")

# Preview data and datatypes
df_sandy %>% glimpse()
```

```{r}
# Clean column names, etc
df_sandy_clean <- df_sandy %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

# names prints the column names of the data frame
df_sandy_clean %>% names
```

```{r}
# data set and pipe to next cmd
df_sandy_clean %>% 
select(contains("address")) %>% 
mutate(
    incident_address_clean = str_to_title( str_trim(incident_address) ),
    school_address_clean = str_to_title( str_trim(school_address) )
    )

df_sandy_clean %>% 
select(contains("street")) %>% 
mutate(
    street_name_clean = str_to_title( str_trim(street_name) ),
    cross_street_1_clean = str_to_title( str_trim(cross_street_1) ),
    cross_street_2_clean = str_to_title( str_trim(cross_street_2) )
    )

df_sandy_clean %>%
select(contains("city"), contains("borough")) %>% 
mutate(
    city_clean = str_to_title( str_trim(city) ),
    borough_clean = str_to_title( str_trim(borough) )
    )

```

```{r}
# identify data series with NA values, remove ones with majority NA
df_sandy_clean %>% 
  filter_all(any_vars(. == "N/A" | . == "Unspecified"))
```

```{r}
df_sandy_na_fixed <- df_sandy_clean %>% 
mutate(
  facility_type = ifelse(
    facility_type == "N/A" | facility_type == "Unspecified",
    NA,
    facility_type ),
  park_facility_name = ifelse(
    park_facility_name == "N/A" | park_facility_name == "Unspecified",
    NA,
    park_facility_name ),
  school_name = ifelse(
    school_name == "N/A" | school_name == "Unspecified",
    NA,
    school_name )
)
```

```{r}
# Columns_missing_most_data is a list of all the columns that were missing more than 50% of their rows. We can use this list to remove these columns in the subsequent code block
cols_w_most_na <- df_sandy_na_fixed %>%
summarise(
  across( everything(), ~ skimr::n_missing(.x) ) ) %>%

pivot_longer(
  cols = everything(),
  names_to = "variable",
  values_to = "missing_count" ) %>% 

mutate(
  proportion_missing = round( missing_count / nrow(df_sandy_clean), 2) ) %>% 
arrange( desc(missing_count) ) %>% 
# Detect columns that were missing more than 50% of the data
filter( proportion_missing > .5 ) %>% 
pull(variable)

print( message("[stathy] Cols with 50%+ NA:") )
cols_w_most_na
```

```{r}
# A minus sign in front of a column name or list of columns removes it from the data frame
df_sandy_na_fixed %>% 
  select(-cols_w_most_na)
```

### d. Title case

Convert the City column to title case. Follow the same approach in step b to solve this questions.

```{r}
# Write your code below
df_sandy_clean %>%
select(contains("city"), contains("borough"), contains("community")) %>% 
mutate(
    city_clean = str_to_title( str_trim(city) ),
    borough_clean = str_to_title( str_trim(borough) ),
    community_board_clean = str_to_title( str_trim(community_board) )
    )
```

![Payment Table Cardinality](./payment_table_cardinality.png)


***

## 1.3 Relational Algebra

*a. List all payments greater than and equal to '2' and less than equal to '7'*

**σ amount >= 2 ^ amount <= 7 (payments)**

*b. List all the movies with title and description that are rated PG-13*

**π title, description (σ rating = 'PG-13' (film))**

*c. Replace the word “film” with “movie” for all attributes and relations starting with the word “film”*

**ρ movie(movie_id) π film_id(σ Condition(film))**

**ρ movie_text(movie_id) π film_id(σ Condition(film_text))**

**ρ movie_actor(movie_id) π film_id(σ Condition(film_actor))**

*d. List all customer names who have returned their rentals in the current month*

**π first_name, last_name (customer) ⋈ (σ return_date = 'January'(rental))**

***

## 1.4 Normalization

*a. For the table below, provide examples of insertion, deletion, and modification anomalies.*

 1. **'Helen Pearson' Physician updates will require multiple row updates**

 2. **New patient insertion may create anomoly in physician details**

 3. **'Jill Bell' Patient updates will require multiple row updates**

 4. **'Huron Street, Chicago' Patient Address updates will require multiple row updates**

*b. Normalize this data to 3NF and list any assumptions made during the normalization process.*

```{r}
library(readxl)
df1 <- read_xlsx(path="./Assignment1-Normalization.xlsx", sheet=1)
df1 %>% glimpse()

df2 <- read_xlsx(path="./Assignment1-Normalization.xlsx", sheet=2)
df2 %>% glimpse()

df3 <- read_xlsx(path="./Assignment1-Normalization.xlsx", sheet=3)
df3 %>% glimpse()
```
